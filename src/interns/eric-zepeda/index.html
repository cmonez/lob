          Howdy! My name is Eric Zepeda, but I used to go by Anthony (my middle
          name). I grew up just north of the city in Marin. I graduated from
          college in 2017 and have decided to make a career transition because
          of my fascination with the Software Engineering mindset.
          <br />
          I'm a right brain thinker with an appreciation for left brain things.
          I love that software engineering is a combination of artistry and
          logic. I love seeing things come to life, and want to leverage the
          power of technology to help people. Down the line, I envision myself
          as someone who will help people break from underrepresented groups and
          non-traditional backgrounds break into the tech industry.

        <p class="explain">
          I want to work at Lob, because I want to work at ridiculous scale. I
          was very impressed to learn that Lob generated mail reaches 1 in 4
          americans. I'd love to pick the brains of the engineering team that
          streamlined Booking.com's process and turned what was a 60 person
          non-stop mailing job into an automated process. Given the scale that
          Lob works at, i'm positive that i'd be learning Engineering best
          practices that i'd then be able to pass onto Junior Engineers once I
          gain more seniority.
          <br />
          After making my first few commits to an open source codebase, I have
          really fallen in love with the spirit of open source. I want to help
          create robust User Interfaces for open source technologies that I
          think will help both Engineers and non-Engineers alike

          Outside of work, I love(d) going to shows, watching NBA basketball,
          and riding public transportation. My favorite genre of music is
          <a

          and my favorite team is the Golden State Warriors. I have also been
          trying to pick up Portuguese as a third language. I am fascinated by
          the idea of lexical similarity and picked Portuguese partially due to
          its similarity to Spanish, which is the first language I learned.
